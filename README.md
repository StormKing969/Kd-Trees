The purpose of this assignment is to create a symbol table data type whose keys are two-dimensional points. Weâ€™ll use a
2d-tree to support efficient range search (find all the points contained in a query rectangle) and k-nearest neighbor search
(find k points that are closest to a query point). 2d-trees have numerous applications, ranging from classifying astronomical
objects to computer animation to speeding up neural networks to mining data to image retrieval.
